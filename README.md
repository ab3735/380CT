# 380CT - Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science - 1617OCTJAN

We will be looking mainly at:

* Foundations of CS: practical & theoretical understanding.
* Formal specification of patterns and “languages.”
* Models of computation and the issues of computability and complexity.
* Algorithmic techniques used to tackle complex problems.

It's fun, cool, intellectually challenging, insightful, ... it is! :-)

## Intended Module Learning Outcomes
On completion of this module the student should be able to:

1. Use formal notation to specify patterns and languages.
2. Specify and simulate various automata.
3. Explain the connection between classes of languages, models of computation and types of algorithms.
4. Classify the computability and complexity of real world problems.
5. Specify and implement methods to estimate solutions to intractable problems.
